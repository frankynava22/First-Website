              <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
              <p>Hey! My name is Francisco Nava, or Franky for short. I was born and raised in Edinburg, Texas and plan to one day move up South to a city that best suites my career. Speaking of career, I am an aspiring computer engineer who has a major passion for everything technology. I'm given the privilage to be enrolled at University of Texas Rio Grande Valley and plan to further my education here for my remaining years. Like everyone else, I hope to succeed in this ever expanding world, but not for myself. You read that correctly, my goal is not to succeed for myself, but for my parents who have given and lost so much just to give me the opportunity to be something in life. I plan to repay them in a major way as soon as i am able to, but that goal is far ahead of me. So for now, i will continue to expand my skills and improve in every way i can until my dream is not just a distant idea, but reality.
